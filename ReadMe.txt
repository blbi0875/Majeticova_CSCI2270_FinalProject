Final Project\ul 
 
Project Summary:

My program will be similar to Assignment number 7 (the movie database). My program will analize swim times from the 
2016 East Coast Nationals in the 50yd freestyle. It will read a document of the names and times. It will store this 
data as a linked list. Once it has read all of the data it will give you many options as to what to do with the data. 
You will be able to do the following: add a swimmer, assign rankings, print the list of swimmers out, remove a swimmer, 
find the average time, determine whether or not the swimmer improved from their expected result and by how much.
